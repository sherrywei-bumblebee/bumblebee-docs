Manage Business and Support Contacts
============================================

Bumblebee platform enables enterprise to manage networking, business and support contacts of their partners, suppliers and 
customers, all on the same platform. This helps speeds up business processes in procurement and in troubleshooting problems. 


For example, an enterprise publishes a B2B application on Bumblebee platform and along with it their 60 partners 
who access the application using. In the past, the partner information is kept in separate places or not kept at all, 
leading to later IT staff not being to call up partner support when changes are needed. 
The prolonged time to make change or fix issues impacts business negatively.
